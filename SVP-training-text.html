NT1 (Core) Definition: The full time annual equivalent (FTE) number of people directly employed on the contract , e.g. as a result of this procurement requirements (if you are the procuring organisation) or other set targets. If you are the bidding organisation or are reporting for measurement, only direct employees should be included here, while employment through supply chain can be captured through NT1c where this is included. Employees should be residing in the local area and with an employment contract duration of at least one year, unless the overall duration of the contract is less (in which case it is at least the overall duration of the contract). Please refer to the definition of local area provided for the contract.  Measure NT1b might signpost specific targeted areas found in LIST NT1b. If you are recording direct employees under NT1b please ensure no double counting occurs.  Please check evidence requirements for details on postcode collection.
"NT1 (Core) Evidence Required: Specify the number of qualifying employees directly employed on this contract (for details on what a qualifying employee is defined as, please see the Definition box of this Measure). For each qualifying employee, specify: 1.) the duration of employment; 2.) the employment status (e.g. full time or part time); 3.) the Full-Time Equivalent (FTE); 4.) the first half of their home postcode (i.e. the postcode district).

"NT1 (Core) Unit Guidance: The proxy value can be applied to a person working full time for a year, so if you are employing people part-time, or if the duration of the contract is shorter than one year, please calculate the full time equivalent (FTE) number of employees for the year. Please note that only direct employees with a contract duration that is at least one year or that lasts the full duration of the contract (if this is shorter than one year) can be included within this Measure. While there is no fixed definition of full time employment, an FTE of 1.0 corresponds to having one person employed on a full time basis for a period of 12 months. For example, two people employed full time for six months would equal 1.0 FTE. We define full time employment here as working at least 35 hours per week.
NT1 (Core) Technical Rationale: Economic benefit for the individual. Fiscal benefits to the government are excluded as they do not benefit the local area directly. UK median wage, Office of National Statistics (ONS) - Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) 2021. The proxy should be localised by using the same dataset and choosing the average across the relevant geographic area. Commitments and deliveries should not be reported as Social Value, but separately as Local Economic Value. An assessment of deadweight should be made for the specific project, by estimating what percentage of the project workforce would have been employed from the local area in a business as usual scenario.

NT3 (Core) Technical Rationale: Average annualised increase in economic benefits to the individual over the course of his/her lifetime. Annualised fiscal benefits to the NHS resulting from average reduction in health care costs associated with being out of work based on Unit Cost Database v2.0 E&E1.0.3, updated to 2021/2022 prices. The operational costs related to the fiscal benefit to DWP and HM Revenue and Customs are now included as in Unit Cost Database v2.0 E&E1.0 and E&E1.0.1 and E&E1.0.2 updated to 2021/2022 prices, which is adding an additional value component to the proxy that was not picked up previously. Remaining fiscal benefits to DWP and HM Revenue and Customs are excluded as indicated in the source. See Unit Cost Database v2.0 for a more detailed cost breakdown. Conservative proxy based on generic JSA claimant. 2.77% deadweight has been applied to reflect the probability for a long term unemployed person of getting off unemployment benefits. This deadweight is appropriate for the first year of employment. For succeeding years of continued employment, deadweight should be adjusted to reflect improved odds of finding a job. Proxy values over £1000 are rounded to the nearest Pound."

For example, two people employed full time for six months would equal 1.0 FTE. We define full time employment here as working at least 35 hours per week.
NT5 (Core) Technical Rationale: The proxy value comprises the value to the individual from entering the labour market (annualised increase in lifetime earnings), the fiscal value to the NHS resulting from an average reduction in health care costs associated with being out of work, as well as the economic, fiscal and wellbeing value to society from preventing reoffending. The figures included in the proxy are the UK values for the population aged 18+. All components are based on Unit Cost Database (UCDB) v2.0 figures, updated to 2021/2022 prices, and MOJ prevention of reoffending statistics. See UCDB v2.0 for a more detailed description of unemployment and crime costs. An across-crimes crime multiplier of 4.3 has been applied to reflect the ratio of estimated total number of crimes (based on the Crime Survey for England and Wales, formerly British Crime Survey) to the number of comparable crimes recorded by the police (a UK weighted average of crime type multipliers - weighted according to the 2015/2020 distribution of reported crimes by typology - derived by GMCA Research Team and presented in the UCDB v2.0). A 3.96 multiplier has been applied to the average number of offences per offender, to take into account unproven offences (based on MOJ Crime statistics). The figures included in the proxy are the UK level values for the population aged 18+. Deadweight is established separately to reflect the reduction in reoffending probabilities for employed rehabilitating offenders (dw: 91%), and the average probability for rehabilitating offenders to be employed respectively (dw: 17%). Deadweight figures should be adjusted to reflect primary data from the project when available, e.g. by using success rates in preventing reoffending from a rehabilitating offender programme run in partnership with (or by) a VCSE. The proxy value is appropriate for the first year of employment. For succeeding years of continued employment, it should be adjusted to reflect an increased probability of finding a job . These have been calculated based on the UCDB v2.0 Economic. Fiscal and Social components and Comments. Proxy values over £1000 are rounded to the nearest Pound."

Value to the individual comprises increased earnings as a result of entering employment. Value to the government includes savings to the NHS related to a reduction in health care costs associated with being out of work. Fiscal benefits to the DWP have been excluded. Deadweight is based on the statistic that 50% of disabled unemployed are very likely to be long term unemployed. Therefore the deadweight figure is a weighted average of the probability of finding a job for a long-term unemployed person and the generic probability of finding a job for the generic JSA claimant. The proxy value is appropriate for the first year of employment. For succeeding years of continued employment it should be adjusted to reflect the increased probability of finding a job. Proxy values over £1000 are rounded to the nearest Pound."

NT8 (Core) Definition: This is the number of staff hours dedicated to the preparation and delivery of curriculum related activities in schools and colleges (talks at universities cannot be captured under this measure) including literacy support, career talks, safety talks, etc. Please provide a description of the range of activities provided. Reported activities should not be double counted with other similar Measures, including NT17 and NT29.
"NT8 (Core) Evidence Required: Provide the names of the schools/colleges visited and a breakdown of the number of staff hours spent on each visit (including time spent preparing and then delivering the session). For example, if 10 staff have spent 3 hours each on a visit, then the total number of hours reported for that visit should be 30. Describe the visits and the activities delivered and provide any supporting information, e.g. a confirmation from the school/college after the visit. Information provided should be made compliant with data protection requirements (GDPR).
NT8 (Core) Target Guidance: Summarise your workplan for delivering your target number of local school and college visits.

NT9 (Core) Definition: This Measure applies to direct employees only and does not include staff upskilling (for upskilling use NT80 and NT81). Time spent as part of training opportunities created specifically for the contract or that are made use of on contract can be counted, for those weeks during which a person works primarily on contract.

"NT9 (Core) Unit Guidance: Record weeks of vocational qualification training provided on the contract, even when the opportunity is supported beyond the duration of the contract, as long as it will be supported to completion.
NT9 (Core) Technical Rationale: The proxy value has been computed by combining the current economic benefit to the individual (based on minimum pay given the distribution of achievements by age and their average length), and the annualised future lifetime value to society of achieving the qualification (based on Unit Cost Database (UCDB) v2.0 updated to 2021/2022 prices, and the distribution of achievements by level). Value to the individual therefore includes current increased earnings and annualised value of future increased earnings as a result of achieving the qualification. It is the lower estimate, and reflects an assumption that 50% of the employment benefit is attributed to the qualification (see UCDB v2.0 for details). Estimates of distribution of achievements by age, average length, and level are based on data from OFQUAL (Ref: Ofqual/21/6859/2; Vocational and Other Qualifications Quarterly: July to September (quarter 3) 2021). Per week attribution of lifetime benefits is based on the assumption that each week equally contributes to achieving the qualification. This assumption is likely to be revisited in future editions, to pick up on non-linearities."

Volunteering is defined by the International Labour Organisation (2001) as ‘unpaid non-compulsory work; that is, time individuals give without pay to activities performed either through an organisation or directly for others outside of the household’. Here staff volunteering hours should only be recorded when time has been allocated for staff to spend on formal volunteering (not for family and friends). In the case of local community projects there might not be a community organisation at the receiving end of the volunteering, but it might be an initiative set up by the company itself based on local intelligence. Time invested in organising such activities must be recorded in this category on top of the staff volunteering time itself.

NT31 (Core) Unit: Savings in CO2e emissions on contract achieved through de-carbonisation (i.e. a reduction of the carbon intensity of processes and operations, specify how these are to be achieved) against a specific benchmark. (tCO2e)
NT31 (Core) Definition: General savings could result, for example, from a deliberate programme aimed at changing processes or from de-carbonisation work. Where possible, savings resulting from specific interventions or achieved in specific areas should be recorded under the Measure(s) that is most relevant (if part of the operative Measure set): - CO2e savings achieved to energy efficiency measures - use NT82 - Indirect CO2e savings achieved along the supply chain (Scope 3 savings) - use NT31a - Transport related CO2e savings resulting from car miles saved (e.g. through cycling to work or carpooling initiatives for employees) - use NT32 - Transport related CO2e savings resulting from freight miles saved (e.g. through green transport plans) - use NT84 - CO2e savings resulting from using low emission vehicles - use NT33.  Reduction should be measured against a pre-existing baseline level of emissions (the level of emission estimated in a given year for the project in the absence of reduction efforts). The Measure therefore requires provision of additional metrics including this baseline level of emissions and a baseline year, the target level of emissions on the project (as determined by the reduction commitments), as well as the relevant net zero carbon target year (e.g. net zero carbon by 2030) as relevant at project or corporate level. Targets for reaching net zero carbon should be specified as a minimum to be in line with a net zero greenhouse gas emissions target of 2050. More ambitious targets are strongly encouraged (e.g. net zero by 2030). The Social Value Portal offers a GHG savings calculator to derive the achieved/committed savings in CO2e emissions. For further guidance on target setting and related baselining please see the Unit and Target Guidance. Should not be double counted with NT31a, NT32 and NT33 or RE37, Re37a, RE39 or RE39a.
"NT31 (Core) Evidence Required: Carbon reductions should be evidenced through an independent and verifiable process (e.g. Planet Mark Certification or equivalent). There is an expectation for independently assured and audited reports to be provided. Specify and evidence the pre-existing baseline level and year that have been used to measure savings/reductions and the total emissions generated as a result of reduction efforts, as well as the relevant emission reduction policy (e.g. net zero by 2050 or earlier). Include any relevant information on how the targeted or realised reductions relate to this emission reduction policy or net zero targets.
NT31 (Core) Target Guidance: Describe the initiatives that you are going to put in place to achieve the identified savings in CO2 emissions on the contract against the specified baseline, including timeframes. These could be e.g. from de-carbonisation work . Specify and evidence the baseline level of emissions used to measure reductions against and the baseline year, as well as the target emissions after reductions (i.e. the level of emissions on the project resulting from your reduction efforts). Also specify relevant emissions reduction policy (e.g. net zero by 2050). This could be a general corporate policy or a specific project policy. Include any relevant information on how the targeted/ realised reductions relate to this emission reduction policy or net zero targets. The purpose of the National TOMs framework is to report added value. This means going above and beyond the minimum required, and to support initiatives that help the world to decarbonise as quickly as possible. It also means pushing for a “green normal”, rather than treating environmental outcomes as a bolt-on or an afterthought. This determines how we establish the minimum requirements for carbon reduction Measures in the TOMs, which adopts the minimum targets identified by the UN, the UK Government, and the scientific community; namely that to keep global temperature rises as close to 1.5 degrees Celsius as possible, it is necessary to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 (“NZC 2050”). While the TOMs adopts this minimum target to 2050 as the baseline, it follows that “added value” in measurement terms should come from the voluntary adoption of targets that exceed minimum requirements. More ambitious targets such as net zero by 2030, embraced by over 100 local authorities across the UK, are becoming increasingly widespread and provide greater scope to mitigate Climate Change than NZC 2050. Where a more demanding emissions requirement than NZC 2050 has been set, this should be adopted."

"NT86 (Core) Evidence Required: For each initiative or project supported, provide a breakdown of volunteering and staff time invested. Only volunteering hours spent during work hours or paid overtime hours can be counted.
NT86 (Core) Target Guidance: Only volunteering hours spent during work hours or paid overtime hours can be counted."
"NT86 (Core) Unit Guidance: Volunteering time spent in multi-stakeholder engagement initiatives and sustainable ecosystem management can be valued at £16.93 per hour.
NT86 (Core) Technical Rationale: The proxy reflects the replacement cost for the wage of the individual volunteering. It is based on the Office of National Statistics (ONS) hourly value of volunteering: based on different types of volunteering being identified in survey data (Community Life Survey) and valued at the closest market equivalent wage rate from the ASHE dataset (2000 till 2015); adjusted by the median gross annual income in 2021.

NT87 (Core) Unit: Total volume of reduced plastics against a relevant benchmark (kg)
NT87 (Core) Definition: Total reduction in the usage plastics (in kg) against a relevant benchmark through reduction activities. Measures designed to avoid plastic usage completely mark the top of the circular economy priorities having the highest impact by preventing already the start of the plastic life cycle with production, usage, managed or mismanaged disposal and decay.
"NT87 (Core) Evidence Required: Provide information of relevance of the adopted benchmark. Provide both your expected total volume of avoided virgin plastics and volume expected above the benchmark. Describe the measures taken or to be implemented to achieve this.
NT87 (Core) Target Guidance: Specify the benchmark or baseline to be used. Provide both your expected total volume of avoided virgin plastics and volume expected above the benchmark. Describe the measures taken or to be implemented to achieve this."
"NT87 (Core) Unit Guidance: No of kg of avoided virgin plastic usage against a typical benchmark.
NT87 (Core) Technical Rationale: The proxy captures the total cost of life cycle GHGe emission, including emission during the production and controlled and uncontrolled waste disposal process, and the cost of plastic pollution on marine ecosystems caused by plastic pollution."

NT50 (Core) Technical Rationale: Input proxy - this proxy measures the value of resources pledged to support, fund or finance existing initiatives in the community. An additional multiplier capturing the rate of investment to impact should be used whenever available in the National TOMs framework Calculator for measurement. This could be e.g. an SROI study developed for the specific initiative supported. Once an appropriate additional multiplier is used the proxy will capture the value to the beneficiaries, with economic, fiscal or wellbeing components included depending on what the additional multiplier adopted is designed to capture.
